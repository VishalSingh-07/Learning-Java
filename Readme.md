Java is one of the top five programming languages, and is used for websites, embedded controllers, and Android app development. This is an introduction to get you started programming with Java 9-and the newly introduced JShell. 

Instructor Kathryn Hodge covers all the basics: data types, strings, arrays, loops, and functions. She helps you control the flow and logic of your code, and debug your project to make sure it runs perfectly. Then go a bit beyond the basics and learn advanced techniques such as encapsulation, inheritance, functional programming, and lambdas.
